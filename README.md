## 2. [T20 World Cup 2022 Analysis](https://github.com/RahulSujith/Rahcode/blob/main/T20%20World%20Cup%202022%20Analysis.ipynb)
This is my personal project in python, done in jupyter notebook to analyse T20 World Cup 2022.
## T20 World Cup 2022 Analysis:
As the ICC Menâ€™s T20 world cup has just finished, it has generated a lot of data that we can use to summarize 
the event and gain insights into the performance of teams and players. By analyzing data such as the number of 
matches won by runs or wickets, toss decisions, top scorers and their scores, best bowlers, and the best stadiums 
to bat and bowl in, we can gain a deeper understanding of the tournament and identify trends and patterns that emerged
during the event. 
I am able to work plotly library and used pandas to explore the dataset.
