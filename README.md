## 1. [Marketing Campaign Analysis](https://github.com/RahulSujith/Rahcode/blob/main/%20RAHUL%20SUJITH%20Marketing%20Campaign%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
This is my python bootcamp project regarding analysis of marketing campaign. 
I cleaned the data and remove the missing values. I also removed the outliers to avoid getting wrong conslusion of analysis.
I mentioned my findings  and analysis in the jupyter file.

## 2. [Created  dashboards using PowerBi and conducted analysis for Airbnb to identify good and bad practitioners.](https://github.com/RahulSujith/Rahcode/blob/main/Data_Viz_Final%20Version%20(2).pbix)
In this data viz challenge I need to clean and analyse the airbnb dataset using powerBI. I created a data story by analysing the ratings and type of cities in which the apartments are located. Also I found the aprtments who have blank rating  and identified good and bad practitioners and provided recommendations to improve the marketing strategy of AirBnb.

## 3. [T20 World Cup 2022 Analysis](https://github.com/RahulSujith/Rahcode/blob/main/T20%20World%20Cup%202022%20Analysis.ipynb)
This is my personal project in python, done in jupyter notebook to analyse T20 World Cup 2022.
## T20 World Cup 2022 Analysis:
As the ICC Menâ€™s T20 world cup has just finished, it has generated a lot of data that we can use to summarize 
the event and gain insights into the performance of teams and players. By analyzing data such as the number of 
matches won by runs or wickets, toss decisions, top scorers and their scores, best bowlers, and the best stadiums 
to bat and bowl in, we can gain a deeper understanding of the tournament and identify trends and patterns that emerged
during the event. 
I am able to work plotly library and used pandas to explore the dataset.

## 4. [BigQuery-SQL Project to Analyse IMDB Dataset](https://github.com/RahulSujith/Rahcode/blob/main/SQL%20Project.pdf)
In this SQL project I explored and analysed IMDB dataset using BIgQuery to gain insights and draw conclusions regarding the data.

I am working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. So we are analysing the Kaggle Dataset (https://statso.io/a-b-testing-case-study/ ). Please fine my finding and explanations regarding the campiagn analysis.

Solution

pandas: Used for data manipulation.

datetime: Handles date-related operations.

plotly.graph_objects and plotly.express: Used for creating interactive visualizations.

plotly.io: Configures visualization settings.

Data Loading:

Two CSV files (control_group.csv and test_group.csv) containing campaign data are loaded into Pandas DataFrames.

Data Cleaning:

Columns in both datasets are renamed for clarity.

Missing values in the control data are filled with mean values for respective columns.

Data Merging:

Control and test datasets are merged based on the date.

B. Data Analysis

Campaign Strategy Analysis:

Number of Impressions vs. Amount Spent:

Scatter plot visualizes the relationship between impressions and amount spent, showing that control campaign impressions are more than test campaign impressions.

Add to Cart Analysis:

Bar graph indicates that the control campaign has more "Added to Cart" actions than the test campaign.

## 11 . [Spotify - Python Data Analysis Project ](https://github.com/RahulSujith/Rahcode/blob/main/spotify.ipynb)

The Spotify Data Analysis Project: In todays changing world data analysis has become crucial in fields such, as business, research and meteorology. This project showcases the role that data plays in making decisions advancing research initiatives and even predicting weather patterns.

The immense potential of data analysis is evident in this project, which focuses on extracting insights from music related datasets using Python. At its core Spotify takes stage as an audio streaming giant with captivating features like seamless song sharing and synchronized lyrics display.

Throughout this project I delved into the realm of data using Pythons libraries and functions. From analyzing to visualizing the data this project covers all aspects of data processing. The interactive environment provided by Jupyter notebook enhanced my experience by allowing me to engage with the data and discover patterns.

Through the Spotify Data Analysis Project I not sharpened my skills but also gained a deep understanding of how data intertwines, with the world of music. This journey provided insights. Equipped me with confidence to undertake similar projects in the future.
